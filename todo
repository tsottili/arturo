todo list:

1. separate a matrix-spot (with neighbours management) and the deck.
2. separate the deck and the tableau (maybe)
3. specialized item (label and buttons)
4. clear division between: game <--> solitaire framework <--> scene framework
5. game flow and structure (ux)
6. allow exchange card position.
7. build a (sort of) cute page!
